    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p> A couple of summers ago, I started noticing this bright orange drink, always in a Miller High Life bottle, popping up online and at bars. What was it?</p>

    <p>The Spaghett. Beer-based cocktails, like beer-mosas, Micheladas, shandies, or beer spritzes are all easy sippers that are refreshing any time of year, but especially so during the summer. </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>beer of choice (Miller High Life recommended)</li>
        <li>Aperol</li>
        <li>fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Remove 2 oz. of beer.</li>
        <li>Add 1 oz. Aperol to the beer in the bottle.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 oz. citrus juice</li>
        <li>Garnish with a lemon wedge (optional)</li>
    </ol>
