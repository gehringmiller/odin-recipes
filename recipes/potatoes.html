    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This is one of my favorite recipes. My dad taught it to me and it couldn't be simpler.</p>

    <p>As you'll see below, it scores very high on the Time Spent vs. Results Yielded coefficient.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes of your choice, as few or as many as you'd like to eat</li>
        <li>Teriyaki sauce (soy sauce is also great)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Wash your potatoes.</li>
        <li>Carefully poke a few holes in each potato with a fork.</li>
        <li>Cook potatoes in the microwave in increments of 2-3 minutes.
            You will know they are done when a fork easily goes into the potato.</li>
        <li>Cut cooked potatoes into wedges or cubes (personal preference) about an inch thick.</li>
        <li>Arrange on a baking sheet or tray and sprinkle liberal amounts of your teriyaki sauce over the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Flip or rotate your wedges to evenly coat all sides your potatoes.</li>
        <li>Let sit for 3-4 minutes to absorb the teriyaki sauce.</li>
        <li>Place on a hot grill and cook for a few minutes on each side. 
            While your potatoes are technically already cooked, this step adds flavor and texture.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy. Say you spent hours on them.</li>
    </ol>
