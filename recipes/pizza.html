    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Who doesn't love a freshly baked pizza? Here's a recipe that's easy enough. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>For the dough:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 (¼-ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the toppings:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Heaping ½ cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh bocconcini mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>10 fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <h4>Make the dough</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together the water, sugar, and the yeast. Set aside for 5 minutes, until the yeast is foamy.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, place the flour and salt. Mix on medium speed until combined. Add the yeast mixture and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Mix on medium speed until the dough forms into a ball around the hook, 5 to 6 minutes. If the dough is too dry to form a ball, add water ½ tablespoon at a time until the mixture comes together. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth ball.</li>
        <li>Brush a large bowl with the remaining 1 teaspoon of olive oil and place the dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Stretch to fit a 14-inch pizza pan or similar.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>After the dough is made:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce onto the dough.</li>
        <li>Top with the fresh mozzarella and tomatoes and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is browned.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil leaves and a pinch of red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with olive oil and serve.</li>
    </ol>
